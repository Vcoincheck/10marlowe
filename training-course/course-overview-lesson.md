# Course overview lesson

### **Overview**

* **Target Audience**: This course is designed for individuals with little to no programming experience or developers who are not specialized in Haskell. It aims to cater to beginners as well as non-expert developers who want to explore Marlowe, a simple smart contract language on the Cardano platform.
* **Course Goal**: The primary objective of the course is to introduce learners to Marlowe and provide a solid understanding of its basic concepts. By the end of the course, participants will have a comprehensive overview of Marlowe and how it can be applied to real-world smart contract development on Cardano.
* **Lecture Focus**: The course will emphasize practical knowledge, with a strong focus on real-world applications of Marlowe. The lectures will be structured to help learners easily grasp core concepts and how Marlowe functions within the broader blockchain ecosystem.
* **Hands-on Practice**: A significant portion of the course (50% of the time) will be dedicated to hands-on exercises. Learners will get the chance to work directly with the Marlowe Playground, an interactive tool that allows for the easy development and testing of Marlowe contracts. This practical component will give participants the opportunity to apply their knowledge and gain firsthand experience in working with smart contracts.

### **Training Course Format:**

* Online via **Zoom**.
* Duration : **8 weeks**.
* Total number of sessions: **8**.
* All sessions will be recorded and **uploaded to YouTube** for future reference.
